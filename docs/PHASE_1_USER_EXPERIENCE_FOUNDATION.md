## 🏗️ Week 2: Information Architecture

### **Current Navigation Problems**
```
Current Structure:
Home → Admin → Upload → Gallery → Dashboard → Settings
     ↓
Complex, technical terms, admin-first hierarchy
```

### **New Navigation Structure**
```
Proposed Structure:
📸 Photos → 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family → ➕ Share → 👤 Profile
     ↓
Simple, task-based, user-first hierarchy
```

#### **New Navigation Rationale**
- **Photos**: Primary entry point - what everyone wants to see first
- **Family**: Social features, member management (simplified)
- **Share**: Upload and sharing tools (context-aware)
- **Profile**: Personal settings and help (everything else)

### **Content Hierarchy Redesign**

#### **Primary Level** (Always Visible)
- **View Photos**: Grid, timeline, search
- **Quick Upload**: Prominent "+" button
- **Family Activity**: Recent uploads, reactions

#### **Secondary Level** (Contextual)
- **Sharing Controls**: When uploading or viewing
- **Organization Tools**: Albums, favorites, tags
- **Social Features**: Comments, reactions, sharing

#### **Tertiary Level** (Progressive Disclosure)
- **Advanced Upload**: Bulk operations, metadata
- **Admin Functions**: User management, permissions
- **Settings**: Preferences, help, account

### **Permission System Simplification**

#### **Current System** (5 tiers - confusing)
```
admin → family → extended-family → friend → guest
```

#### **New System** (3 levels - human language)
```
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Only (immediate family)
🏠 Extended Family (includes relatives)  
🔒 Just for Me (private)
```

#### **Visual Permission Indicators**
- **Color Coding**: Green (family), Blue (extended), Gray (private)
- **Icon System**: Consistent icons across all interfaces
- **Plain Language**: No technical jargon

### **Mobile-First Information Architecture**

#### **Bottom Navigation** (Primary Actions)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│           Content Area              │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📸 Photos | 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family | ➕ Share | 👤 Me │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### **Progressive Enhancement for Desktop**
- Same navigation structure
- Additional sidebar for admin functions
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Larger touch targets adapt to mouse precision
