## Automated Testing Recommendations

### High Priority for Puppeteer
1. **Authentication Flow**: Login with admin/non-admin users
2. **Upload Happy Path**: Complete file upload flow
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Upload same file twice
4. **Admin Access Control**: Verify unauthorized access blocked
5. **Database Persistence**: Verify files appear in correct year database

### API Testing Priorities
1. **Admin Authentication**: `/api/media` endpoints with various user types
2. **Duplicate Check**: `/api/upload/check-duplicate` with various scenarios
3. **Presigned URLs**: `/api/upload/presigned` with different file types
4. **Database Operations**: Verify JSON files created/updated in R2

### Test Data Requirements
- **Sample Images**: JPG with EXIF (2007, 2020, 2024), PNG without EXIF, WEBP
- **Sample Videos**: MP4, MOV with metadata
- **Edge Case Files**: Large files (49MB), corrupted files, duplicates
- **Admin Users**: Valid emails in `ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable
- **R2 Configuration**: Valid bucket with proper CORS setup

## Known Issues & Recent Fixes

### Recently Fixed Issues ‚úÖ
1. **JSON Database Not Writing**: Fixed database update step in upload flow
2. **Duplicate Detection Wrong Year**: Fixed to use photo date instead of upload date
3. **Admin Access Control**: Fixed server-side admin validation with proper email checking

### Areas Needing Attention üîÑ
1. **Duplicate Detection Testing**: Need to re-test after recent fixes
2. **Cross-Year Duplicate Scenarios**: Verify adjacent year searching works correctly
3. **Large File Upload Performance**: Test with files approaching 50MB limit
4. **Mobile Upload Experience**: Ensure drag & drop works on mobile devices
