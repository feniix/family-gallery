## ✅ **NEW ENHANCEMENT: Advanced Access Control with AlaSQL**

### **Implementation Completed** ✅

**Core Features Added**:
- **AlaSQL Integration**: SQL-like querying engine for complex media filtering and access control
- **Hierarchical Permissions**: 5-tier access system (admin → family → extended-family → friend → guest)
- **Tag-based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on media tags and user restrictions
- **Advanced Search**: Complex queries supporting date ranges, camera info, GPS data, file types
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass permission updates for multiple media items
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights into access patterns and permission usage

**Files Implemented**:
- ✅ `src/lib/access-control.ts` - Core AlaSQL-powered access control system (15KB)
- ✅ `src/app/api/access-control/route.ts` - API endpoints for access control operations
- ✅ `src/components/admin/access-control-panel.tsx` - Admin interface for permission management

**Key Capabilities**:
- **SQL-like Queries**: `SELECT * FROM media WHERE tags LIKE '%vacation%' AND visibility = 'family'`
- **Complex Filtering**: Multi-field search with JOIN-like operations across metadata
- **Permission Analytics**: Real-time breakdowns of media visibility and user access patterns
- **Custom Access Rules**: User-specific allowed/denied tags and content restrictions
- **Bulk Management**: Efficient mass updates for media permissions and user roles

**Integration Benefits**:
- **Enhanced Security**: Granular control over content visibility based on tags and user roles
- **Scalable Architecture**: SQL queries handle complex permission logic efficiently
- **Admin Efficiency**: Bulk operations reduce manual permission management overhead
- **Flexible Tagging**: Advanced access control beyond simple subject filtering
